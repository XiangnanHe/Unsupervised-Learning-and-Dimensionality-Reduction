This report includes using both Weka and Scikit-Learn.
1)Python sklearn were used in the clustering algorithms for K-means and EM, also for ANN.
2)Java was used for DR analysis with J48 performance comparison. (The lower ranked components are added one per step for the evaluation)
3)The original datasets are included in "Codes" folder and are named letter.arff(or letter.csv) and wisconsin.arff(or wisconsin.csv).
4)Download and use Weka for dimensionality reduction with PCA, ICA, RP and IG algorithms. FastICA needs to be downloaded for ICA, here is the link: https://github.com/cgearhart/students-filters
5)Save the data to arff and csv files for feeding to java code or python code to do dimensionality reduction analysis and clustering analysis. 
6)The final plots are mostly done with Excel.
